# Migration Phases & Plan

The purpose of this project is to migrate content from the old system (Texis) to the new system (Drupal). This endeavor involved several phases and aimed to enhance content management and delivery capabilities. Although the initial migration was successful, various issues and delays were encountered throughout the process. The migration project commenced in August 2022 and reached completion in March 2023.

### **Requirements**

The migration process was structured into the following phases:

1. **MVP SOW and Proof of Concept (POC):** The initial phase involved the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Statement of Work (SOW) and the execution of a Proof of Concept (POC). The primary objective was to assess the feasibility of the migration. The successful completion of this phase was a pivotal milestone for the entire project.
2. **Migration of Global Site and Expansion:** Following the successful POC, the project proceeded to migrate the global site. Subsequently, the migration efforts extended to encompass additional countries and regions.

#### **Issues Encountered**

During the migration process, several challenges were encountered:

1. **Buggy Initial Patch:** The first patch delivered to the client contained bugs, underscoring the need for rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures.
2. **Grouped Site Delivery:** Initially, a group of sites was delivered together instead of migrating them individually. This deviation from the planned approach added complexity to the project.
3. **Missing Scenarios:** Numerous scenarios were identified as missing during the migration process. These gaps were discovered either in the source data feed or during the development phase, highlighting the importance of meticulous planning and comprehensive scenario coverage.

### **Viewing**

It is important to note that the migration process is not directly visible in terms of content viewing, as it involves backend data transfer and system restructuring. The content is now accessible through the new Drupal system.

Additional information can be available within the [Migration Issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6HG1FfNOj-wrzjRHL_7TaOENGWDarOwly9wZUy2NuY/edit#gid=1967638025) document, which comprises the following components:

1. Migration Report: This section contains data pertaining to the quantity of content types migrated, along with the associated feeds and the taxonomies integrated into the new system.
2. Scenario Mapping: Included herein are detailed accounts of unique and exceptional cases encountered during the execution and testing of the migration feeds, accompanied by the recommended courses of action for each scenario.
3. Feedback: This section encompasses the compilation of issues, cases, and reported bugs that were documented during the comprehensive testing of the migration process across all sites.

### **Important Notes**

From the challenges faced during the migration process, the following valuable lessons were learned:

1. **Adequate Sample Data:** It is essential to work with a substantial sample of pages for each content type during the planning and testing phases to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy.
2. **Detailed Delivery Planning:** A meticulously detailed plan for content delivery, including site-by-site migrations, can help streamline the process and reduce complexity.
3. **Early Stakeholder Involvement:** Involving all relevant stakeholders at an early stage of the project is crucial for effective communication and alignment of objectives.

In conclusion, this content migration project, which commenced in August 2022 and concluded in March 2023, encountered challenges but also provided valuable insights for future migrations. The lessons learned will undoubtedly contribute to the success of similar endeavors in the future.

# Media Library

Media Library is a media management tool that enables you to find media that exists on your site and to add new media items. It allows you to search, sort, and create media items with a robust, easy-to-use, and customizable interface.

It can be used to add media items to an entity reference field or embed media into your content via a text editor.

# Entity Queues

Entity Queues allow users to create queues of any entity type. Each queue is implemented as an Entityreference field, that can hold a single entity type.

Entityqueue provides Views integration, by adding an Entityqueue relationship to your view and adding a sort for Entityqueue position. Entity Queues are used throughout the site to order and promote content.

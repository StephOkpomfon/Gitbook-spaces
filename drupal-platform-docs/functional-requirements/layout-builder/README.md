# Layout Builder

Layout Builder allows content editors and site builders to easily and quickly create visual layouts for content display. Users can customize how content is arranged on a single page or across types of content or even create custom landing pages with an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.

### Requirements

#### Landing Pages

* Editors should be able to create dynamic landing pages on the site to allow them to create engaging visual content for the users
* Editors should be able to select from defined templates for pages that are available to all editors on all sites
* Editors should be able to access reusable blocks to be used on the landing pages
* Editors should be able to configure dynamic views on the landing pages

Note:

* The layout for the landing page should not restrict the admin to upload a large header image
* Header images should respond well to different screen sizes

#### Layout Improvements

* As an editor, I see the save layout button at the bottom of the layout builder as well as top.
* As an editor, I see less prominence of discarding changes and revert to defaults are not yellow buttons.
* As an editor, I can see the custom blocks list first rather than selecting it twice.

#### General Changes

* To enable the "Reorder Layout Builder sections" patch.

### Acceptance Criteria

* As an editor, I can create an anchor link within the rich text editor.
* As a site end user, I can quickly jump down the page content using an anchor link.
* As an editor, I can choose all available column layouts.
* As an editor, I can edit the column layout.
* As a site end user, I can see the columns appearing correctly (desktop).
* As a site end user, I can see the content as expected on mobile.
* As a designer, I am happy that the design is appearing as expected (desktop).
* As a designer, I am happy that the design is appearing as expected (mobile).

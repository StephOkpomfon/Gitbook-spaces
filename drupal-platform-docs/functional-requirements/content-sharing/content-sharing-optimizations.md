# Content Sharing Optimizations

### Requirements

#### Content Sharing Lock

This feature enables content authors to lock a page, preventing any edits when it's synchronized through content sharing to other sites.

#### User Experience Changes

While the team is engaged in content sharing, they have put forth several user experience (UX) enhancements:

1. Renaming terminology: The request is to make terminology more familiar and user-friendly for easier comprehension.
2. Status messages: The team has asked to include status messages when an admin user selects specific options that could potentially impact the synchronization process.
3. Default content locking: The proposal is to set content to be locked by default when "Manual sync" is chosen for importing content to other sites.
4. Admin user content display: Admin users should see published content exclusively in their view.

#### Auto Sync Page

The editorial team requested the removal of the auto-sharing option from the site admin role while maintaining a page that lists the channels created for automatic synchronization per site.

# Translations Connector

The Translations Connector is a module that provides administrators with the ability to link an existing page as a translation. This module is designed to enhance the multilingual capabilities of a website and simplify the translation management process.

To gain an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects and specific usage details, we recommend referring to the official documentation on the Drupal project page: [Translations Connector Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/translations_connector).

### Requirements

* Some Global AR pages (and possibly Global ES and FR) were migrated as standalone pages, not translations. Now, editors need to manually copy the content from the standalone page into the translation page, unpublish the standalone page, and set a redirect to the translation.

### Acceptance Criteria

* As an editor, I want to be able to link an existing page as a translation.

# Emergency

The Emergency content type serves the purpose of adding and updating information about new emergencies occurring in countries that require assistance.

### Design Reference

* [Emergency Content Type](https://www.sketch.com/s/6ecd71b4-af49-42b4-9d65-0e9d20134b89/a/QbyArEe)

### Requirements

The 'Emergency' content type has been developed to facilitate the creation of content related to the emergencies supported by UNHCR. This content type includes most of the fields available in other content types. However, for emergencies, there are specific fields that have been added:

1. **Statistics:** Site administrators can input up to three statistic numbers listed at the bottom of the media header for each emergency.
2. **Pre-title Heading:** This field allows for including text or information that appears just before the main title on the page.
3. **Update Date:** The 'Update Date' is prominently displayed at the bottom of the media header, providing the most recent date when the emergency content was updated.
4. **Data Portal Link:** The site admin can add a hyperlink to provide access to additional reports and information related to the specific emergency.

These fields have been introduced to enhance the presentation of emergency-related information, making it easier for users to access and understand the latest updates and statistics regarding UNHCR-supported emergencies.

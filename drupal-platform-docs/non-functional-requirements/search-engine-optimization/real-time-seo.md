# Real-time SEO

Real-time SEO module helps you optimize content around keywords in a fast, natural, non-spam way.

This module checks things you're bound to forget. It checks whether your posts are long enough if you've written a meta description and if that metadata contains your focus keyword if you've used any subheadings within your post, etc.

Real-time SEO can be configured on the site by going to [https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/config/yoast\_seo](https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/config/yoast_seo)

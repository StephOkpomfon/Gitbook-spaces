# Pathauto

The Pathauto module automatically generates URL/path aliases for various kinds of content (nodes, taxonomy terms, users) without requiring the user to manually specify the path alias. This allows you to have URL aliases like /category/my-node-title instead of /node/123. The aliases are based upon a "pattern" system that uses tokens that the administrator can change.

Pathauto can be configured on the site by going to [https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/config/search/path](https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/config/search/path)

# Google News Sitemap

A sitemap contains detailed information about specific types of content on your site. Google News sitemap lets you control which content you submit to Google News. we made sure to create a Google news site map for the news content type.

For the Google news sitemap the path will be:

```
https://mvp.unhcr.info/news-sitemap.xml
```

We made sure that the sitemap will meet google expectations which is:

* We included URLs for _news_ that were published in the last two days, we also removed news pages that are older than two days.
* The sitemap can contain up to 1,000 URLs, as Google suggested.
* We update your current sitemap with your new _news_ URLs. We don't create a new sitemap with each update.

# Taxonomies Migration

The taxonomic migration process was a collaborative endeavor with the UNHCR team. The core of this migration relied on a custom-developed script meticulously designed by the team to harmonize legacy terms with their corresponding counterparts in the new system.

### **Requirements**

As Texis employed distinct identification codes for each term, contingent upon the language, the migration commenced with English taxonomies. Subsequently, the same script was systematically applied to replicate this process across other languages. This approach was specifically implemented for the following taxonomies from Texis:

1. Categories
2. Type
3. Keyword

### **Important Notes**

During the migration process, the UNHCR team played a pivotal role in mapping legacy Texis terms to their corresponding counterparts in the Drupal taxonomy structure. An agreement was established that guided the migration strategy: Terms were migrated only if a specific mapping to a term in the Drupal taxonomy existed. The term would be excluded from the migration process in cases without mapping.

This meticulous mapping process ensured the seamless transfer of taxonomies from Texis to Drupal, preserving the integrity and structure of the content classification system in the new environment.

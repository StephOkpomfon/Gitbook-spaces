# Pull Entities

After successful authentication, all the shared content (from the server end) will be available to the client site at[https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/content/entity\_share](https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/content/entity_share) to be pulled and displayed at its end.

{% hint style="info" %}
This provides **an added advantage to the client-side** where it can accept the shared content only after complete verification. The shared content simply does not get created as soon as the server shares it.
{% endhint %}

Moreover, the interface that the module provides for the entities to be pulled is user-friendly and easily understandable. It clearly depicts newly created and already pulled content along with its synchronization status. In case the content after being shared and pulled gets edited either at the server or client-side, the status gets immediately updated.

# Remotes

The client site contains remote data that includes:

1. The remote/server URL that it needs data from
2. Authorization details like user and password to connect to the server

All will be provided after enabling the submodule entity\_share\_client using the command:

```
drush en entity_share_client
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Note this module needs to be enabled on the site that will pull shared content.
{% endhint %}

# Channels

**Channels** stands for the entities which can be shared, and they need to be added using the **Add channel.**

Creating channels on the server site containing exact data to be exposed from its end channel configuration needs enabling the **entity\_share\_server;** which is a submodule present within **entity\_share** using the following command:

```
drush en entity_share_server
```

Additional filtering and sorting rules can be set on these channels as required by visiting this URL: [https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/config/services/entity\_share/channel](https://mvp.unhcr.info/admin/config/services/entity_share/channel)

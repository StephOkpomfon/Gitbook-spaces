# Blocks and block types

Blocks are made available to your site most commonly by enabling core or contributed modules. Once created, a Block can be modified to adjust its appearance, shape, size, and position - or which Website pages it appears on. For example, enabling the core Poll module makes the "Most Recent Polls" block available for you to place in a region. Also, note that some modules provide multiple blocks when enabled, others may not define new blocks. The site is using the following custom block types:

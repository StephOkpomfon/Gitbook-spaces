# Create Content

## **Adding Content**

Users can add content to the site with predefined content types throughout the site.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Before you begin**: Make sure you are logged in as a user who has the right to create content â€“ ask your system administrator if you are not sure; otherwise, some of the fields you need to select will not be visible.
{% endhint %}

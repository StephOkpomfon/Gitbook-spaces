# Images Guidelines

The below table is a guideline for the specific sizes for the images per section.

The images on the site will always be scaled to fit the desired location.

* If a larger image is uploaded than needed, the site will resize it as much as possible then crop in order to fit the image correctly.
* If a smaller image is needed, the site will scale the image and stretch it to fit the desired location.
* The uploaded image should have a size not more than 800 Kb and bigger than this standard size will affect the site performance.

| Section            | Aspect Ratio | Image size |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Hero slider- Image | 16:9         | 1600x550   |
|                    |              |            |
|                    |              |            |

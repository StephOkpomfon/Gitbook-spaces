# Project Overview

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights, and building a better future for people forced to flee their homes because of conflict and persecution.

The UNHCR team expressed the necessity to replace and upgrade their Content Management System (CMS) for their global and country-specific websites. This imperative arose due to their utilization of the outdated and unsupported programming language "Texis," prompting the desire to transition to an open-source platform for website development.

This [multisite](developers/unhcr-multisite-setup/) initiative, "UNHCR - The Project," encompasses the global website hosted under the domain unhcr.org, designated by the UNHCR team, and the multitude of country-specific websites reliant on the Texis system.

### Discovery & Analysis Phase

Before embarking on any development endeavors, Vardot and the UNHCR team diligently conducted a comprehensive discovery phase commencing in January 2021, spanning over several months. During this phase, the team orchestrated meetings and workshops with key stakeholders affiliated with the UNHCR to ascertain the project's precise requirements and objectives.

### The Project MVP

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) phase was initiated in August 2021 and successfully concluded in February 2022. The primary objective of this phase was to establish and validate that the new CMS and website structure align with the envisioned expectations and seamlessly fulfill the operational requirements of the UNHCR.

### Private Events + Glossary SOW

The editorial team has submitted requests for alterations to the existing Events structure, necessitating additional investment in terms of both time and cost. Furthermore, there is a requirement to introduce a new content type called "Glossary" to accommodate these changes.

The team successfully implemented the changes for the Events as per the agreement. However, it was mutually decided to treat the creation of the "Glossary" as a post-launch task. Given the issues that arose and required resolution after the initial launch, the UNHCR team was responsible for developing the "Glossary" content type.

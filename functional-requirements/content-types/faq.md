# FAQ

The FAQ content type was developed and designed to efficiently compile and display frequently asked questions from both visitors and staff.

### Design Reference

* [FAQs Landing Page](https://www.sketch.com/s/6ecd71b4-af49-42b4-9d65-0e9d20134b89/a/xrd3kd0)

### Requirements

#### FAQs

* Editors should be able to add, edit, and delete faq on the site
* Editors should be able to connect the faqs to a specific category
* Editors should be able to add views on specific pages based on a specific category

### Viewing

{% hint style="info" %}
The client asked to eliminate the content type because the admin users are already using the [Accordion](../layout-builder/custom-blocks.md) custom block to list the questions, and there's no need for the content type.
{% endhint %}

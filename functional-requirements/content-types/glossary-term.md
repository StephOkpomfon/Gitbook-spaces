# Glossary term

The Glossary Terms content type was developed and designed to manage the UNHCR Master Glossary's terms and definitions effectively.

### Design Reference

* [Glossary Content Type](https://www.sketch.com/s/6ecd71b4-af49-42b4-9d65-0e9d20134b89/a/oYA2Rjn)

### Requirements

* To create a Glossary page in the system.

### Viewing

* [Glossary Page](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary)

### Important Notes

* Given the pressing need to meet the Go-Live date for deploying the new sites, the UNHCR team decided to postpone this task for after the launch. However, since the team was primarily focused on addressing post-launch issues and bugs, the UNHCR technical team went ahead with the content type development on their own. They completed the task and merged it into the final code, and it is now available on the production site.

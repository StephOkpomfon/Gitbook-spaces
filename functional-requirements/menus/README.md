# Menus

The primary emphasis of the menus is to be accessible to site admins, whether at the global or country level, to provide maximum flexibility for users to customize both the content and the order of menu items, along with all associated elements.

### Requirements

### Mega Menu Vs. Simple Menu

The Mega Menu is primarily intended for use on the global site. It will encompass an expanded menu list with custom blocks beneath each main menu's first level.

Conversely, the Simple Menu is designed for utilization on the country sites. This menu will be characterized by two menu levels, offering a streamlined navigation experience tailored to the specific needs of these localized sites.

The mega menu was primarily designed for use on the global site, and it underwent significant changes and enhancements during the development phase.

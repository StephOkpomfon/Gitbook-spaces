# Refugees Media

### Requirements

#### Integration with Refugee Media Repository

* Editors should be able to easily import files from Refugee Media into Drupal.
* Editors should be able to view all images/media items inside Refugee Media inside Drupal and select the media entity directly to their page.
* Editors should be able to embed a media item from Refugees Media with all it's metadata and alt tags.

#### Media Improvements

* **Automatically import the field “Description” (RM) into the field “Caption” (Drupal).** Once imported, the caption field on Drupal needs to remain editable, as editors will use the info imported from RM as a starting point to customize the caption depending on the content they’re creating.
* **Automatically import the field “Credit line” (RM) into Drupal’s “Copyright” field. The © symbol should be automatically imported.** The Copyright field on Drupal should remain editable as editors need to “translate” the credit line, i.e., © UNHCR/Photographer to © ACNUR/Photographer.

# Admin Bar Colour

Editors sometimes found it challenging to discern whether they were working in the English backend, Spanish backend, or any of the other available languages. To enhance their experience, the UNHCR team will have the option to choose distinct colors for the backend bars according to the selected language, simplifying the identification of the editing environment.
